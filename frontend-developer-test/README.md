# React frontend assignment

My solution for the assignment! I have added files called "InfoTable.js" and "InfoTable.test.js" and done some minor tweaking to "App.js". The tables have been created using material-ui and the tests have been done with jest!

Sorting the tables can be done with the little arrow button on the side of the "Date" header and tables can be changed with the button "CHANGE TABLE" besides the loading button.

### npm start
to start the app

### CI=true npm test
to run the tests
